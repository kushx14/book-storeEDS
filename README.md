## 🧠 State Management
All application state is managed using NgRx Signal Store.

| Store | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| UserInfoStore | Authentication & JWT |
| BooksStore | Books, details, inventory |
| CartStore | Cart & checkout |

No RxJS global state or ad-hoc variables are used.
